# BBC Micro Assembler Template for VSCode #

## Requirement ##
- BEEB VSC Visual Studio Code Extension (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=simondotm.beeb-vsc)
- BeebASM Assembler (http://www.retrosoftware.co.uk/wiki/index.php/BeebAsm)
- BeebEm Emulator (http://www.mkw.me.uk/beebem/)
- Visual Studio Code, or course (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Included ##
Included in this template are two "Hello World" examples.
- File #1 (HelloWorld.asm) showing the traditional way of coding assembly
- File #2 (HelloWorld2.asm) showing how we used to do it in the Good 'ole Days nesting instructions on the sdame line.

## How to use the template ##
Just open the file you wan to assemble, press ``` CTRL +  SHIFT + R ``` (windows keys, other may vary).

- Then select ``` Build Current File ``` to assemble the file and build a .ssd in the same name as the assembled file.
- and then press ``` CTRL +  SHIFT + R ``` again, this time select ``` Run Current ASM File '.ssd' in Emulator ``` to open up BeeBem and load the .ssd and run (if its an auto run disk)
